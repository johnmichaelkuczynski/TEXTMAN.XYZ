PROTOCOL FOR RECONSTRUCTION FUNCTION:

SUPPOSE THAT USER PUTS IN SHORT TEXT AND ASKS FOR VERY LONG OUTPUT. 
THE APP GIVES HIM WHAT HE WANTS. PERIOD. IF THE USERS PUTS IN A SHORT TEXT (OR A LONG ONE) AND PROVIDES NO CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS, THEN THE APP GOES ON DEFAULT MODE. BUT IF THE USER GIVES IT INSTRUCTIONS RELATING TO THE TEXT, THE APP FOLLOWS THOSE INSTRUCTIONS TO A TEE. PERIOD. PERIOD. FOR EXAMPLE, SUPPOSE THE USER SAYS THE FOLLOWING: 

"TURN THE FOLLOWING INTO A 20000 WORD DISSERTATION.: Consciousness is not an emergent property of neurons in any explanatory sense. When scientists discovered that air pressure results from molecular collisions, they provided a causal mechanism—billions of particles striking container walls per second. This explains why pressure exists. But when neuroscientists say consciousness "emerges" from neural activity, they provide no comparable mechanism. We know brains consist of neurons because we looked through microscopes, not because neuronal composition explains consciousness. The air pressure case and the consciousness case are fundamentally disanalogous: molecular theory was inferred FROM pressure phenomena to EXPLAIN them, whereas neuronal composition was discovered independently and explains nothing about why subjective experience exists. Calling consciousness "emergent" merely redescribes the mystery. Emergence is an epistemic notion—it characterizes our ignorance, not a causal mechanism. Temperature IS mean kinetic energy (identity). Consciousness is not identical to neural firing in any coherent sense. Until we know WHY appropriately configured neurons generate experience rather than mere information processing, we don't know why consciousness exists. Searle's analogy fails completely.
